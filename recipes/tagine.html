    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A tajine or tagine is a North African dish, named after the earthenware pot in which it is cooked.</p>
    <p>The tagine's conical shape makes a uniquely moist, hot environment for the dish being cooked.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>1 lemon</li>
        <li>8 bone-in, skin-on chicken</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps to follow</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the spices in a bowl and mix up</li>
        <li>Season both sides of chicken pieces with 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pan over medium-high heat until beginning to smoke. Brown the chicken pieces skin side down in single layer until deep golden, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Using tongs, flip the chicken pieces over and brown the other side, about 4 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Transfer the chicken to a large plate; when cool enough to handle, peel off the skin and discard.</li>
        <li>Pour off and discard all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the pan, reduce the heat to medium, and add the onion.</li>
        <li>Cook, stirring occasionally, until they have browned at the edges but still retain their shape, 5 to 7 minutes (add a few tablespoons of water if the pan gets too dark).</li>
        <li>Add the remaining minced garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the spices and flour.</li>
        <li>Stir in the broth, honey, remaining lemon zest, and 1/4 teaspoon salt, scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken (with any accumulated juices) back in, reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Scatter the carrots around the chicken, cover, and simmer until the chicken is cooked through and the carrots are tender-crisp, about 10 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Add the olives, garlic-zest mixture, cilantro, and 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice.</li>
        <li>Stir to combine and adjust seasoning with salt, pepper, and more lemon juice, if desired</li>
        <li>Serve with couscous.</li>
    </ol>
